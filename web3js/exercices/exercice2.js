// Exercice 2: ussing the account created in the previous exercice transfer ether to that address.

// First we are going to check our current balance, it should be 0


// We need to calculate the gas necessary to make the transaction


  // After the gas is calculated we can make the transaction. We need to sign it first with the private key

  

    // When the transaction is signed, it is ready to be sent

    

      // This event is received when the transaction is mined
        

      // Finally we check out balance again
